# Customer Segmentation Using Unsupervised Learning

## Objective
Cluster customers based on their spending habits and propose tailored marketing strategies for each segment.

## Dataset
Mall Customers Dataset

## Project Overview
This project applies unsupervised learning techniques to identify distinct customer segments, enabling targeted marketing efforts.

## Steps Performed
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**  
  Analyzed the dataset through visualizations and summary statistics.

- **K-Means Clustering:**  
  Grouped customers into clusters based on their spending and demographic features.

- **Dimensionality Reduction and Visualization:**  
  Used PCA and t-SNE to visualize the clusters in lower dimensions.

- **Marketing Strategy Recommendations:**  
  Suggested marketing strategies customized for each customer segment.

## Skills Gained
- Unsupervised learning (K-Means clustering)  
- Dimensionality reduction (PCA, t-SNE)  
- Customer segmentation and profiling  
- Data-driven marketing strategy development

## How to Use
1. Load and explore the Mall Customers Dataset.  
2. Perform feature scaling and preprocessing.  
3. Determine the optimal number of clusters with the Elbow method or Silhouette analysis.  
4. Fit the K-Means clustering model on the data.  
5. Visualize clusters using PCA and t-SNE plots.  
6. Interpret clusters and recommend marketing strategies accordingly.
